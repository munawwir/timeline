- realizing his mistake he tied himself to one of the mosque’s pillars until Allah revealed his forgiveness
- he was tied for 25 days until the Prophet ﷺ set him free

#### Truth in Action
- Aws asked to be lenient with Banu Qurayza
- Sad ibn Muadh was chosen as arbitrator
- Sad: men killed, property divided, women and children taken as captives

#### Decision consistent with the law of Moses
- Deuteronomy stated this exact punishment
- Book of Numbers: same but with the examples of the Midianites
- decision carried out
- Sallam ibn Abu’l Huqayq main aggressor was assassinated
- punishment was a deterrent and a firm statement to prevent future treachery
- also frightened and discourage the hypocrites

#### Benevolence and Largesse
- Muslims went to Najd and captured Thumamah ibn Athal (chief of Banu Hanifah)
- He was tied to a stump in the Prophet's ﷺ mosque
- Prophet ﷺ asked him, “What do you imagine will happen to you, Thumamah?”
- After 3 days was released, left the city and came back after taking a bath to accept Islam
- Went to Makkah for Umrah and blocked all grain from al-Yamamah

- Shaban 6 AH Banu al-Mustalaq were gathering to attack
- Muslims went out in force to respond; included were a large number of hypocrites
- They defeated Banu Mustaliq and began to head back
- There was a quarrel between a Muhajir servant and an ally of Ansar further flared by Abdullah ibn Ubay
- The Prophet ﷺ ordered to break camp and leave only stopping to rest when everyone was tired
- Abdullah ibn Abdullah ibn Ubayy was a worthy son who would not allow his father to enter Medina unless he acknowledged he was an unworthy wretch; the Prophet ﷺ said to deal kindly with him
- Aishah (ra) accompanied the Prophet ﷺ during this expedition and during a break had dropped her necklace, went to search for it, and when she (ra) returned to the camp the army had moved on
- Safwan ibn al-Muattal found her, allowed her to mount his camel while he quickly led it forward
- This was not an uncommon occurrence for the wayfaring Arabs
- Abdullah ibn Ubayy took advantage and created rumors about this incident
- When Aishah (ra) found out he was brought to tears
- The Prophet ﷺ presented this issue to the sahaba and they were ready to enact revenge, but the Aws and Khazraj began to argue and the Prophet ﷺ calmed them down
- Aishah (ra) was confident about her innocence and Allah revealed verses confirming this
