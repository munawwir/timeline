# Chapter 16: The Expedition to Khaybar
### Doctorsab

#### The Divine Reward
- Allah had promised a reward to those who pledged allegiance at Hudaybiyyah (Bayt Ridwan)
- Khaybar was a very strong Jewish colony 70 miles to the northeast of Medina
- they were seeking revenge for their brothers and aligned with the tribe of Ghatafan
- they incited and supported local tribes to fight the Muslims

#### The Apostle ﷺ Leads the Army
- Muharram 7 AH
- 1400 men (200 cavalry), 20 women to nurse the wounded and prepare meals
- those not present at Hudaybiyyah were not allowed to join
- stopped at Raji (a valley) between Khaybar and Ghatafan to block communication
- no food was found for the army except corn
- they marched early in the morning before the call to prayer

#### The Victorious Commander
- Marhab was a warlord who held the citadels
- Muslims were unable to overtake them
- Ali (ra) was suffering from inflammation of the eye; the Prophet ﷺ applied spittle and cured
- The following day Ali (ra) was given the standard and told to fight

#### Ali Faces the Jewish Warrior
- Marhab came out in full armour reciting poems about valor
- Ali (ra) rushed to him and both began to battle
- Ali (ra) plunged his sword into his helmet and head and brought down the fort
- Maslamah (ra) also fought bravely

#### An Easy Reward
- A slave in Khaybar was watching over the flocks of his master
- He saw the others going to fight and asked where they were going
- He was told they were fighting a man who claimed to be a Prophet
- He came to the Prophet ﷺ and asked what would he get in return if he became a Muslim
- he was told he would get Paradise; he became Muslim and died during battle
- The Prophet ﷺ saw his body and said “Allah blessed this man (ra) and brought him to Khaybar. I saw two houris standing by his side although he never prostrated to God.”

#### I did not come to you for it
- A bedouin joined the expedition and received a large booty after one of the forts were captured
- He asked what this was and once he found out it was his share he said this is not what he came for
- He was killed in a subsequent battle and the Prophet ﷺ covered him with his own mantle and prayed for him
- Khaybar fell and initially the Prophet ﷺ wanted to banish them from the city, but they requested to stay, citing they knew how to till the fields
- The conditions were they could stay, the Muslims would receive half the produce, and the agreement could be abrogated unilaterally by the Prophet ﷺ
- Abdullah ibn Rawahah (ra) was sent to evenly divide the produce

#### Religious Tolerance
- Part of the booty included Jewish scriptures, which were ordered to be returned to the Jews with care
- Dr. Welphenson commented on the difference between the Romans and the Muslims in religious tolerance

#### Arrival of Jaafar ibn Abi Talib
- Jaafar ibn Abi Talib (ra) and other emigrants arrived from Abyssinia while the Prophet ﷺ was still at Khaybar
- The Prophet ﷺ said “I don’t know which gives me greater pleasure - the conquest of Khaybar or the arrival of Jaafar”

#### Another Conspiracy
- Zaynab bin Hadith, wife of Sallam ibn Mishkam, presented a roast lamb with poison to the Prophet ﷺ
- He ﷺ took a bite and spit it out and asked them why they did this
- They said they wanted to kill him ﷺ
- He forgave them but when Bishr ibn al Bara died from the poison, then Zaynah was slain

#### Effect of the Conquest of Khaybar
- The conquest of the citadels and forts demonstrated the Muslims were a force to be reckoned with
- Many of their enemies hoped they would be defeated

#### The Spoils of Khaybar
- The Muslims headed to Fadak in the north and came to an agreement to provide half their produce for the welfare of the Muslims
- In Wadi al Qura they fought back and refused to accept Islam, but lost the battle
- The date-palms were left to them
- This led Tayma to make peace and allowed them to keep their property

#### Magnanimity of the Muhajirin
- The emigrants returned the property the Ansar had given them
- Some were also given additional compensation

#### The Missed Pilgramage
- In 7 AH the Muslims did Umrah for 3 days
- Allah revealed “has given you near victory beforehand”

#### Rights of Women Restored
- All Muslim men and women were equal, only superior in terms of morals and piety
- Ali, Zayd, and Jafar (ra) all wanted to care for the daughter of Hamza (ra)
- The Prophet ﷺ settled the matter and gave preference to Jafar as he was the husband of the girls maternal aunt
- The Prophet ﷺ consoled Ali and said “You are mine and I am yours”
- The Prophet ﷺ reassured Jafar “You resemble me in your looks and conduct”
- The Prophet ﷺ comforted Zayd “You are my brother and client”
