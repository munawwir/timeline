# Chapter 21: The Expedition to Tabuk
### Doctorsab

- Expedition against the Byzantine Empire
- The world held the Romans in great esteem
- Romans even believed that a Prophet would be coming
- the Muslims could not have imagined attacking the Byzantine Empire
- Ghassanids were under the control of East Syria and Ceasar and were a constant threat to the Muslims
- Heraclius had defeated the Persians and were a world power to be dealt with
- the Prophet ﷺ received word the Byzantine forces were gathering on the Northern frontiers of Arabia with the intention of attacking the Muslims
- The idea was to demonstrate Islam as a force to be reckoned with into the neighboring power which was a potential source of danger for the expanding empire
- fight those near to you and let them find harshness in you
The Christian tribes in the north were impressed by the Muslim empire and drove home the empire was here to stay and expand

#### The time of the expedition
- Rajab 9 AH
- date crop ripened and shade of trees were pleasant
- the hypocrites did not want to go out into the heat to fight so they did not join

#### Enthusiasm of the Muslims
- many Muslims donated to the cause
- several poor Muslims could not raise enough and there were no funds to support them
- Allah revealed verses stating they were not to blame

#### The army’s departure for Tabuk
- 30,000 men were in the army
- Muhammad bin Maslamah al-Ansari was left in charge of Madinah
- Ali (ra) was in charge of the family
- They passed through the land of Thamud and were ordered to not drink any of it’s water and to remember the torture the people of this land were going through

#### Demoralized hypocrites
- a few hypocrites joined and would say things to demoralize the army
- Do you think that the executioners will deal with you in the same way the Arabs do

#### Treaty of Peace with Aylah’s ruler
- Yuhannah ibn Ru’bah was the governor of Aylah and made a treaty of peace with the Prophet ﷺ
- they paid the jizya tax and were granted safety for their land, sea, and caravan

#### Back to Medina
- the Romans did not budge and stayed put
- only one group led by Ukaydir ibn Abd Al-Malik was planning an attack
- Khalid ibn Walid was sent with 500 troops, captured him and brought him back
- he agreed to pay to the tax and his life was spared

#### Funeral of a poor Muslim
- Abdullah Dhu’l Bijadayn was exiled from his tribesmen for accepting Islam
- he was poor and only had two pieces of clothing with him when he died at Tabuk
- the Prophet ﷺ buried him with his own hands and made dua for Allah to be pleased with him in the same way that he ﷺ was please with him

#### Trial of Ka’b ibn Malik
- Ka’b ibn Malik, Murarah ibn ar-Rabi, and Hilal ibn Umayyah stayed behind in the expedition of Tabuk
- they were early Muslims and in fact the latter two fought in Badr
- this was perhaps a test for the Muslims to reflect on
- the indecision and indolence that was shown is something commonly seen among humans and is something that we can relate to when we want to do something
- Ka’b intended to go but kept delaying and delaying until it was too late
- all 3 were called on to prove their sincerity to the deen
- Ka’b was called to the Prophet ﷺ to explain himself and gave the truth that he has no excuse at all and was never richer and stronger than when he stayed behind
- the people were commanded not to speak to the three of them; the Muslims obliged so much so that their own families refused to interact with them
- Ka’b continued to go outside to prayers and the market and no one spoke with him while the other two shut themselves in their homes in constant tears
- Ka’b would go and pray next to the Prophet ﷺ watch with half an eye to see if the Prophet ﷺ would look at him or would say Salam in hopes that he ﷺ moved his lips in reply
- even Ka’b’s cousin Abu Qatada, who was closest to him, refused to speak with him
- they were ordered to separate from their wives but not divorce them
- Ka’b was sent a letter from the king of Ghassan being sympathetic to his plight and telling him he could come to their kingdom to be treated with kindness; Ka’b knew this was a test and threw the letter in the fire
- Allah revealed verses in Surah Tawba (9:117-118) forgiving them

#### The expeditions at a glance
- the Prophet ﷺ had 27 battles and 60 expeditions with only 1,018 deaths both Muslim and non Muslim
- the environment was so safe such that a woman could travel alone on her camel without fear
- there were two main principles
- persecution is worse than slaughter
- there is life for you in retaliation
- every battle was accompanied by strict instructions to be kind to friends and foes
- when this is compared to the modern world there is a stark difference

#### The first Hajj
- the command for Hajj was in 9 AH
- Ali (ra) was sent to proclaim this at Mina
- this was the end of idolatry at Makkah
