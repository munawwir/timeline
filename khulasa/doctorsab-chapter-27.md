# Chapter 27: Mercy of the World
### Doctorsab

#### We sent you not save as a mercy for the people
- The world was at a terrible state in the 6th century
- The Age of Ignorance of moral corruption, depravity, decadence, inequity, exploitation
- The destiny of the entire human race was at stake
- A man made a bonfire and when it illuminated the surroundings, insects began to jump into it. You also want to take a leap in the fire in a like manner, but I am holding you your waists to save you from falling into the eternal fire
- When a civilization becomes over sophisticated it begins to ignore ethics

#### The Prophet ﷺ brought a several ideals to live for and humble human existence
1. He ﷺ removed the fear of everything else except the creator freeing them from the shackles of superstition
2. Concept of equality and brotherhood of mankind placing the various races and tribes on the same plane
3. Human dignity to demonstrate that humans are entitled to respect and honor as the best of creation not just people who claimed to be gods and demigods
4. The surest way to attract blessings of God is to be kind and considerate to others

#### Mankind lost faith in the mercy of God
- Man felt condemned to the predestiny taught by Hindu and Christian religions without any reference to action
- The Prophet ﷺ reinstated the idea that man was in charge of his actions, both good and evil, and reward or punishment were given in accordance to it
- Sins were temporary deviations due to nafs and Shaytan but defeated through repentance
- The Prophet was known as the “Apostle of Repentance”
- Allah is one who is ever willing to forgive sinners defeating the despair and despondency of prevailing thought
- To be despaired of God’s mercy is a sin

#### Unity of Spirit and Matter
- Religion is not separate from the mundane - intention could turn something good into evil and evil into good
- All aspects of human existence is a virtuous deed with noble intentions
- The existing thought was a distinct separation between religion and secular
- This divide created a schism for the ambitious to leave religion altogether leading to atheism
- The Prophet ﷺ converted the entire life of man into devotion of God by uniting the two

#### Conscious of the ultimate end of life
- Goals were wealth, fame, power, materialism, amusement
- Reset the goals to exerting oneself to attain the perfect knowledge of God and seek his pleasure
- Mercy and kindness were the greatest virtues
