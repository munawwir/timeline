# Chapter 17: The Expedition to Mut’ah
### Doctorsab

- Harith ibn Umayr al-Azdi was sent to deliver a letter to Shurahbil ibn Amr al-Ghassani
- He was a satrap (governor) of the Byzantine Emperor at Busra
- Harith was tied up and then beheaded
- This was contrary to the protection that envoys typically had
- It dishonored the envoy and the sender

#### First Expedition to the Byzantine Territory
- A detachment was sent to Busa in Jumada al-Ula in 8 AH
- Zayd ibn Haritha was in charge of 3000 soldiers
- Ja’far ibn Abu Talib would take command if Zayd was killed
- Abdullah ibn Rawahah would take command if Ja’far was killed
- The force advanced to Ma’an in Syria
- Heraclius was present at Balqa with 100,000 soldiers plus 100,000 additional forces from the Arab tribes of Lakhm, Judham, Bulqin, Bahra, Baliyy
- The Muslims camped and sent a message to see if they would receive reinforcements

#### Dauntless Warriors
- Abdullah ibn Rawahah gave a speech to the men
- We do not fight the enemy with the strength of our numbers or power
- We fight with the religion with God has honoured us
- We shall be winners either way: we win or we court martyrdom

#### Action Starts
- Muslims reached Balqa and Byzantine forces were stationed in Masharif
- The enemy advanced and the Muslims took positions in a village called Mu’tah
- Zayd ibn Harithah, Ja’far, and Abdullah ibn Rawahah each fought valiantly and received multiple wounds before being killed

#### Khalid assumes command
- Khalid (ra) took command and each army retreated after a full day of fighting
- in the early next morning he had a separate group of soldiers make loud cries of war to make the enemy think it received reinforcements
- the Romans were disheartened and decided not to take the field and the Muslims were spared fighting

#### A Glimpse of the Battlefield
- The Prophet ﷺ was describing the conflict while he ﷺ was in Medina
- As he announced the death of Zayd, Ja’far and Abdullah ibn Rawaha (ra) he ﷺ had tears going down his face
- “Finally one of God’s swords took the standard till God granted them success”

#### Ja’far At-Tayyar
- The Prophet ﷺ said Allah has given Ja’far two wings in place of arms and he flies in Paradise, wherever he likes
- Ja’far came to be known as Ja’far at-Tayyar

#### Words, Kind and Comforting
- The Prophet ﷺ went to the house of Ja’far and met with the children while in tears
- When news reached the Prophet ﷺ about Ja’far he said to his own family to prepare food for the family of Ja’far as they would be too shocked to cook their food

#### Not deserters but warriors
- The army returned and Ja’far’s son Abdullah (ra) was brought to the Prophet ﷺ and was seated next to him
- some people started throwing dust on the men saying they were runaways
- the Prophet ﷺ said “they are not runaways but warriors”

#### Subsequent Expeditions
- there were several raiding parties between Mu’tah and Makkah
- Dhat as-Salasil in Quda’ah near Wadi al-Qura in 8 AH destroyed the enemy
- Sif al-Bahr and Khabat: 300 Ansar and Muhajireen under Abu Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah were sent to Najd to chastise a clan of Juhaynah; the army had to live on leaves of trees for a few days until Allah brought them a what named “Anbar” from the sear
- they ate for 15 days and brought back some which the Prophet ﷺ took and said “God sent it for you”
