# Chapter 14: The Truce of Hudaybiyyah
### Doctorsab

#### Vision of the Prophet ﷺ
- The Prophet ﷺ saw a dream of entering Makkah and doing tawaf
- The sahaba were excited to go as it had been many years and forced to abandon it
- All began making preparations for the journey

#### Trip to Makkah
- Dhul-Qadah in 6 AH the Prophet ﷺ left with the intention of performing Umrah
- No intention of performing Hajj
- Stopped and camped at Hudaybiyyah near Makkah
- With him ﷺ were 1400 sahaba in Hiram, sacrificial animals
- This showed he ﷺ was going for umrah and not war
- A man of Khuzah was sent to see the response; when the Prophet ﷺ reached Asfan he was informed that Ka’b ibn Luayy and his tribe gathered a force of nomad warriors to check his advance
- The Prophet ﷺ began to move forward but Qaswa stopped; when the Prophet ﷺ urged her on, she got up and started walking towards Hudaybiyyah
- She stopped at an area with a ditch with little water; many companions were thirsty so the Prophet ﷺ shot an arrow into the ditch and water gushed for everyone to drink

#### Irritation of the Quraysh
- The Quraysh were upset that the Prophet ﷺ had camped so near Makkah
- Uthman (ra) was chosen to speak to the Quraysh to tell them they are not here for war but for Umrah
- Uthman (ra) was also told to invite the Quraysh to Islam

#### Love put to trial
- Uthman delivered the message to Abu Sufyan and the other leaders of Quraysh
- They told him if he (Uthman) wanted to do tawaf he could do so, but he responded that he wouldn’t until he Prophet ﷺ did
- When he returned the sahaba felt happy that he got a chance to do tawaf
- He replied, “Don’t be unfair to me, I declare by Him Who holds my life that if I were detained there for a whole year and the Prophet ﷺ were to remain in Hudaybiyyah, I would not have circumambulated the Kabah until the Prophet ﷺ had done so.”

#### The Pledge of Ridwan
- The Prophet ﷺ was misinformed that Uthman had been killed and gathered the people under a tree
- The Prophet ﷺ took an oath from all 1400

#### Parleys, Conciliation and Accord
- Budayl ibn Warqa from Khuzah came with his clansmen and asked the Prophet ﷺ what he had come for
- The Prophet ﷺ explained they were here for umrah and would like to make peace but if nothing is acceptable to them he ﷺ is prepared to fight
- Urwah ibn Masud al-Thaqafi advised the Quraysh to accept and offered himself to meet with the Prophet ﷺ
- When Urwah went to meet the Prophet ﷺ he noticed the actions of the sahaba: when the Prophet ﷺ spat the companions ran to get it on their hands and rub it on their faces, vied to comply with his orders, struggled with each other to get the water he ﷺ used for wudu, and would pay attention immediately when he spoke but would not look straight into his eyes
- Urwah went back and said he had seen the courts of the kings and leaders but “never have I seen any king so revered as Muhammad ﷺ by his Companions”

#### The Treaty of Peace
- Mikraz ibn Hafs (from Banu Kinanah) arrived in Makkah and confirmed what was said
- Suhayl ibn Amr was sent & once the Prophet ﷺ saw him he said “it seems they want peace”
- They prepared a draft of the agreement

#### Exemplary Moderation and Prudence
- The Prophet ﷺ asked Ali (ra) to write: In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful”
- Suhayl said he does not recognize Ar-Rahman
- So the Prophet ﷺ said to write “In thy name, O Allah”
- Then he ﷺ asked Ali to write “This is what Muhammad the Messenger of God has decided”
- Suhayl disagreed and said to write Muhammad ibn Abdullah
- The Prophet ﷺ said “I am God’s Messenger even if you disbelieve me”
- He ﷺ asked Ali (ra) to erase it, but he couldn’t, so Ali (ra) showed him ﷺ where and he erased it

#### Treaty or Trial
- The Prophet ﷺ dictated that the Quraysh would allow them to do tawaf this year
- Suhayl said next year and the Prophet ﷺ agreed
- Suhayl said if a Makkan goes to Medina he should be returned even if he’s a Muslim
- An argument started until Abu Jandal (Suhayl’s son) appeared in chains and Suhayl demanded his son
- The Prophet ﷺ and Suhayl agreed on returning Abu Jandal
- The treaty was finalized to include 10 years, returning of a Makkan to Medina, no return of a Medina to a Makkan, and anyone could enter into a bond and security with either the Prophet ﷺ or Quraysh

#### Faith Put to Trial
- The Muslims were sad they had to leave without performing Umrah
- Umar (ra) said to Abu Bakr (ra): Didn’t the Prophet ﷺ say we would do tawaf?
- Abu Bakr (ra) responded: Did he ﷺ tell you it would be this very year?
- The Prophet ﷺ sacrificed his animals and shaved his head and the Muslims followed

#### Ignominious Peace or Signal Victory
- Allah revealed in the Quran that the truce was not a setback but a signal victory
- Umar (ra) asked if it was a victory and the Prophet ﷺ said it was

#### Failure or Success
- Abu Basir Utbah ibn Usayd escaped the Quraysh and came to Medina
- Two Makkans followed and demanded he be returned, which he was
- On the way back he escaped and fled to the coast
- Abu Jandal and 70 Muslims also escaped and joined Abu Basir on the sea shore
- They began to attack and kill any Quraysh that would pass by them
- The Quraysh wrote to the Prophet ﷺ to stop them and dissolved the demand of returning a Makkan

#### The Treaty Turns to Victory
- The Muslims were now considered worthy to have treaties with other states
- Peace allowed dawah to the tribes of the desert
- People began to meet in safety and converse together
- Just 2 years later the Prophet ﷺ went to Makkah with 10,000 men
- Muslims left behind in Makkah began to convert others and joined Abu Basir’s group

#### Khalid ibn Al-Walid and Amr ibn Al-As
- Khalid (ra) became Muslims soon after the treaty
- Amr (ra) accepted Islam too
- Both were amazing generals
