[Birth and early life of Rasulullah ﷺ](../events/0570_Birth_to_prophethood.html) | 96-97 | She suckled Rasulullah ﷺ when he was a baby. At first, she was reluctant, since she needed money and a fatherless child's family would likely not pay much. However, she was inspired to take in the baby, and once she did she found sudden blessings in her home. She was so taken by Rasulullah ﷺ that even after he was weaned, she asked Āminah if she could keep him a little longer. A few months later, two angels came and opened his chest to remove the black spots from him and wash his heart. (See https://sunnah.com/muslim:162b)
