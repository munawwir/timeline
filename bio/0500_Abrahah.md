### Abrahah al-Ashram
#### ~500 - 570

### Summary

Abrahah was an [Aksumite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum) Christian general in southern Arabia and ruler of Yemen as vicegerent of the Abyssinian king, Negus. He had a cathedral in San'a, Yemen, called al-Qullays (fig. 2). Abrahah's desire to replace the Ka'bah with his cathedral led to his vilification by the Arabs.
