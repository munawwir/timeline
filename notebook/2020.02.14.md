12 mice (6 Bmal1 f/f, 6 Bmal1 f/f AlbCre (liver KO)) that had been used in SPF metabolic cage studies we sac'd. Of those 12, 3 were dissected and had cecal contents removed.

Tools and table were cleaned using 70% ethanol before use.

Cecum was cut out from mouse and mesenteric fat removed. Using clean glass slides and forceps, cecal contents were pushed out of cecum and onto a clean weigh boat. From all 3 mice, a total of 0.994 g cecal contents was collected.

Cecal contents were placed into a 15 mL conical. 10 mL of preservation solution from [2/6/2020](2020.2.6.md) was added. Tube was vigorously mixed using vortex to homogenize. Tube was then centrifuged briefly by pulsing to 1500 G. Supernatant aliquoted to 1 mL in Eppendorfs and frozen at -80Â°C.
