### E14 Growth Curve

Up until now: E14 was grown on PYG plates and a blood agar plate (3/6/20). One or more colonies were picked from the PYG plates and grown in suspension in PYG (3/9/20). 2 of these were chosen for dilutions at 1:100, 1:250, and 1:1000 (3/10/20). After overnight incubation, they were found to be empty on 3/11 and 3/12, so the bacteria was diluted too much.

Made PYG modified media so that we can restart the experiment for next week.
