### WT vs Bmal KO mice GF metabolic cage experiment
##### 12.9.2019<br>Sumeed Yoyo Manzoor<br>[The Chang Lab](https://changlab.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago
###### Continued from []().<br>Continued on []().

**Overview:**
- 6 cages set up on 12/9, 6 more cages will be set up after the New Year
- The experiment will have three phases:
  1. BMR measurement - during quiescent phase of the diurnal cycle, mice are fasted for 4 hours and then metabolic rates measured for 3 hours. Lowest metabolic rate in those 3 hours is taken as BMR
  2. 5 days of mice in normal conditions in cages. Last 3 days are used for data analysis
  3. Wheels are added to cage, 4 days of mice in cages. Last 3 days are used for data analysis

**Experiment**
6 cages were set up

**_for future_**
- Gas tubes should be taped to lid to prevent bulkiness in the BSC
- Filters need to be checked. They seem to fall out easily after autoclaving
