Made PYG modified media.

First, made 500 mL salt solution:

Item                                | Amount (g)
------------------------------------|-----------
CaCl<sub>2</sub> x 2 H<sub>2</sub>O | 0.125
MgSO<sub>4</sub> x 7 H<sub>2</sub>O | 0.25
K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>        | 0.5
KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>        | 0.5
NaHCO<sub>3</sub>                   | 5
NaCl                                | 1
DI Water                            | 500 mL

Solution is filter sterilized.

Haemin solution:
- Dissolve 50 mg haemin in 1 mL 1N NaOH
- Make up to 100mL with DI water
- Store refrigerated

Vitamin K<sub>1</sub> solution:
- Dissolve 0.1 mL of vitamin K<sub>1</sub> in 20 mL 95% ethanol
- Store refrigerated in a brown bottle

PYG modified media

Ingredient  |  Amount
--|--
Trypticase peptone  |  5 g
Peptone  |  5 g
Yeast extract  |  10 g
Beef extract  |  5 g
Glucose  |  5 g
K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>  |  
  |  
  |

Tween 80 is very viscous and is best to add after water has been added.  
Haemin and Vitamin K can be added before autoclaving

Solution is mixed. 500 mL is moved to a new container with 7.5 agar and the remaining 500 mL does not have agar added.  
Solutions are autoclaved. Media + agar is plated.
