We've attempted the first trial of working in GF with the equipment using SPF conditions and simulating the GF setting. The WIP SOP is listed [here](../SOPs/Metabolic Cages GF setup and calibration.html).  


CO2 output - all mice all columns  
pipe through kernel analysis, kmeans, pca  
multivariate  
linear projection - to see which factors are associated with which mouse  
linear factor analysis - figure out which factors are driving separation  
use ML random forest

The mice don't need to be in the cages all the time - the cages can be used for GF stuff, then we can take the mice out and leave in rack system while another experiment can happen.


Note: once a mouse has been in the cages for an experiment, esp male mice they must be housed individually afterwards.

Think about mice flow - movement of mice to the rack system? Just train the mice in the isolator. Once the mice are moved to either rack or met. cage, they should never go back to the isolator.
