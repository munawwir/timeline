Goal: I need to make gavage solution that we can use multiple times for GF conventionalization, since the GF mice are at different ages and will need to be gavaged on separate days. To this end, I need to make a preservation media to freeze SPF mice cecal contents.

Recipe from Julia and Jason:

Ingredient    | Amount
--------------|-------
PBS (sterile) | 1X
Glycerol      | 20%
Cysteine      | 0.1%

Must be filter sterilized.

Procedure:

0.1 g cysteine was dissolved in 40 mL PBS in a 50 mL conical. Dissolved by warming the cold PBS to room temperature in a water bath and shaking the conical. Then, in an Erlenmeyer, added another 40 mL PBS, then added 20 mL glycerol. Mixed by swirling then filter sterilized.
