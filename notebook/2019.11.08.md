For packaging scale, scale should have red sliding insert in the scale so the scale can be placed under other items during gas sterilization.  
In the future, weights can just be packaged in the same packaging as scale, and the entire set be placed in a larger bag with the mass hoppers.  

Gas sterilizable items sent in for sterilization, should be ready early next week.
