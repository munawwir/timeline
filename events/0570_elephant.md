### Year of the Elephant
#### 570 CE

### Summary

This incident began with [Abd al-Muttalib](../bio/0497_Abd al_Muttalib.html) and [Abrahah](../bio/0500_Abrahah.html). Abrahah seized 200 camels from Abd al-Muttalib and made his way to the Ka'bah to destroy it. He was jealous and indignant of the Ka'bah, since he felt it took away from his Christian religion. He wanted pilgrims to visit his church instead. As he marched towards the Ka'bah, Abd al-Muttalib went to him to ask for his camels back. Abrahah treated him with respect when he arrived, but when Abd al-Muttalib mentioned his grievances Abrahah was surprised. Abrahah said, 'how can you ask me about these camels when I have come to destroy the House which your religion and the religion of your forefathers depends on?' To which Abd al-Muttalib said, 'I am the owner of these camels and the House, too, has an Owner that will defend it.'  
Abrahah thus set out to destroy the Ka'bah, and the  Makkans fled his approaching army. On the way to the city, his elephant would not let him continue, and birds came carrying stones. These stones pelted his army to death, and Abrahah himself fled to Yemen but met a gruesome fate instead. Only 5 years later, all Abyssinian influence in Arabia was removed.  
This was a testament to Allah's protection of His house. The miraculous event was commemorated as an important year, named the Year of the Elephant
