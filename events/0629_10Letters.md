- He died in 641 in Constantinople

#### Chosroes II
- Khusro Parvez, 4th son of Hormouz, grandson of Chosroes I (Anushirvan the Just)
- Hormouz was killed and Chosroes II took over, but needed protection from Maurice the Byzantine Emperor
- The Persian empire was restored, but Maurice was killed by Phocas and took the throne
- Chosroes II invaded Byzantine in 604, defeated Phocas and went deep into their empire
- This was when Heraclius awoke and Chosroes II had to seek refuge in exile
- He was considered the greatest emperor of Persia, ostentatious and luxurious
- He had many victories, wealth, and was known as Abrawiz/Parvex, meaning victorious in Arabic
- Persia had immaculate food, drinks, perfumes, liquors , music
- He amassed large amounts of gold and had 880 million mithqals in his exchequer (bank account)
- His reign lasted 37 years

#### Muqawqis
- Governor of Egypt on behalf of the Byzantine Emperor
- Jurayj ibn Mina al Muqawis (George, son of Mina)
- Possibly Copt or Roman
- After the Persians conquered Egypt, George was made Archbishop from 621 to 630
- Known as the chief of the Copts
- Most fertile land of the Byzantine Empire

#### Negus
- Ethiopia, eastern Africa, also known as Abyssinia
- One of the oldest, possible queen of Sheba was Abyssinian
- Initially Jews then Christians became the dominant faith
- Jewish monarch of Yemen persecuted Christians, Negus sent army
- Captured Yemen in 525 and held it for 50 years
- Abrahah was the viceroy in Yemen
- Had friendly relations with Byzantine Empire, respected its independence
- Official title: Nagusa Nagashi or King of Kings of Ethiopia
- Likely the one who received the letter was the king who succeeded the Negus who gave initial asylum
- This second Negus accepted and was prayed for during the return from Tabuk in 9 AH

#### Reaction of the Monarchs
- Negus and Muqawkis showed high regard to the envoys and even sent some gifts
- Two slave girls, one was Mariyah who gave birth to Ibrahim (ra)
- Chosroes II tore the letter to pieces and the Prophet ﷺ responded “Even so shall God shatter his kingdom to pieces”
- Badhan (Chosroes’ governor in Yemen) was told to bring the Prophet ﷺ to Ctesiphon
- Babwayh came to Madina and was told, “God has given Sherveh power over his father and he has killed Chosroes II”
- Chosroes’ son Qubadh seized the throne; Chosroes was murdered in March 628 and the Sassanids empire came to an end
- Qubadh only rules for 6 months, then 10 other rulers ruled over 4 years until Yazdagird III, the last Persian Emperor

#### Heraclius and Abu Sufyan
- Abu Sufyan was called to Heraclius to describe the Prophet ﷺ
- Best lineage: prophets come from the best lineage
- no prior claims: is not imitating anyone
- no king in the family: not trying to recover the kingdom
- the poor and weak follow: prophets are always followed by the humble and poor in the beginning
- followers are increasing: faith always increases until it is triumphant
- adherents don’t leave: faith once settles doesn’t leave
- He ﷺ never told lies before: wouldn’t be truthful then lie
- He ﷺ never broke his word: prophets never break promises
- fights against Him ﷺ results have varies, and He ﷺ teaches not to associate partners, offer prayers, be virtuous, speak the truth, be kind to kinsmen
- He ﷺ will conquer the ground that is beneath my feet, and if I had been with him I would have washed his ﷺ feet
- ”If you desire safety and guidance so that your kingdom shall be firmly established then follow the Arabian Prophet” - he called this a test and subsequently lost his kingdom to Umar (ra)

#### Who were the Arisiyyin?
- Arisiyyin or Yarisyyin was the word the Prophet ﷺ used in the letter to Heraclius
- it means servants and the peasants
- can also mean chief or elder who is obeyed
- if it means the former it likely should have been used for Persian people who were peasants and countrymen; Romans were artisans and craftsmen and called the Magians arisen
- can also mean Arians or the followers of Arius (280-336), the founder of a Christian sect which believed in one god and did not share substance with a son
- Church of Alexandria by the 4th century held the view that Father and Son were identical; Arius spoke out against this and was condemned; people continued to argue about this
- Constantine summoned the council of the whole of the church in 325 in Nicaea, attended by 2030 bishops
- Constantine gave the decision in favor of the Trinity but only 326 bishops agreed while the majority favored Arius
- Constantine initially banned then lifted the ban on Arius, who returned and Constantine was about to accept Arianism but Arias then died suddenly
- Nicene Dogma of Trinity violated the plan and simple teachings of Christ
- mostly eastern Byzantine Christians did not believe in the Trinity
- Theodosius the Great (346-395) summoned another council and sealed the Trinity and made Arianism a capital offense and suppressed it
- so arisiyyin likely meant Arians as Heraclius was faithful to the dogma of Arius

#### Letters to the Arab Potentate
- Mundhir ibn Sawa, ruler of Bahrayn, accepted Islam; Abu Ubaydah found a whale during a raid
- Jayfar and Abd, sons of al Julanda of Oman, accepted Islam
- Hawdhah ibn Ali of Yamamah said he would accept only if given part of the dominion, he later died; Musaylamah Kadhdhab belonged to the tribe of Banu Hanifah
