### Battle of Uhud
#### 625 CE

Placeholder: [Doctorsab's khulasa](../khulasa/doctorsab-chapter-11)

#### Revenge: A Binding Obligation
- many Quraysh leaders killed in Badr => saddened and confused
- used profits from Abu Sufyan’s caravan to fight the Muslims
- Shawwal, 3 AH, 3000 Makkan soldiers (plus surrounding tribes) + women + noble’s wives
- camped outside the gates of Madīnah
- Rasulullah’s ﷺ plan: don’t fight unless they enter the city
- [Abdullah ibn Ubayy](../bio/Abdullah_ibn_ubayy) agreed, but Muslims who missed [Badr](0624_Badr) persisted to fight so the Prophet ﷺ put on his coat of mail => then they felt bad in persuading him against his will
- “It does not befit a prophet, once he has put on armor, to lay off until he has fought”
- Muslims marched out with 1000 soldiers, but 1/3 defected with Abdullah ibn Ubayy who said “He disregarded my advice but accepted theirs” - now only 700 soldiers left

#### The Prophet ﷺ Takes the Position
- 3 km north of Medina with Mt. Uhud behind them - “Let none of you fight until I give you the word”
- 50 archers to block cavalry under Abdullah ibn Jubayr: “Abandon not your position even if the birds snatch up these men.”
- Prophet ‎ﷺ put on 2 coats of mail
- Standard given to Musab ibn Umayr

#### Enthusiasm of the Youngsters
- Samurah ibn Jundub a and Rafi ibn Khadij - sent back because they were too young (15 yrs old)
- Rafi’s father persuaded the Prophet ﷺ that he was a good archer
- Samurah said he could defeat Rafi in wrestling => they had a match => Samurah won + given permission to fight

#### The First Phase of Action
- Hind ibn Utbah led women singing and rattling tamborines
- Abu Dujanah was killing everyone with the sword of the Prophet ﷺ

#### Martyrdom of Hamzah and Musab ibn Umayr
- Hamza killed a lot of the Quraysh nobles
- Wahshi: slave of Jubayr ibn Mutim, promised freedom if he could kill Hamza, expert javelin thrower
- Jubayr’s uncle (Tuayma) was killed by Hamza in Badr
- Wahshi threw the javelin, struck Hamza in the lower body, and was martyred
- Musab ibn Umayr fought until he was martyred

#### Victory of the Muslims
- Quraysh nobles were killed and the troops retreated
- Hind and the women stopped singing and began to run away

#### The Table Turns on the Muslims
- The archers saw the Quraysh retreating and thought the Muslims won and ran for booty
- Abdullah ibn Jubayr unsuccessfully tried to remind them of the Prophet’s ﷺ command
- The Makkan calvalry were free from the threat of arrows and charged through the rear of the Muslim army
- Someone called out, “Muhammad has been killed!”
- The retreating soldiers joined the cavalry to take advantage of the confusion
- Makkan troops charged close to the Prophet ﷺ and were led by Abdullah ibn Qumiyah and Utbah ibn Abi Waqqas
- Many sahaba martyred and the Prophet ﷺ was hit by a stone, fell on his side, hit one of his front teeth, scoured his face, and injured his lip
- “How can a people prosper who have stained their prophet’s face with blood while he summons them to their Lord?”
- Muslim soldiers scattered, didn’t know where the Prophet ﷺ was
- Ali took the Prophet ﷺ hand, Talhah ibn Ubaydillah lifted him up, Malik ibn Sinan licked the blood flowing from the Prophet ﷺ face
- The Muslims had to regroup to gather their strength
- All due to the mistake of the archers but were forgiven by Allah (3:152)

#### The Loving Companions
- Two rings from the helmet’s metal chain strap went into the Prophet ﷺ cheek
- Abu Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah lost two teeth pulling out the metal
- Abu Dujanah used his back as a shield and was struck with many arrows
- Sad ibn Abi Waqqas was given arrows by the Prophet ﷺ to shoot
- Qatadah ibn Nu’man’s eye fell out of the socket; was replaced by the Prophet ﷺ and his eyesight recovered better than before
- The enemy surged to the Prophet ﷺ and 10 sahaba died defending him
- Talhah ibn Ubaydillah’s hands became paralyzed from profuse bleeding; he helped the Prophet ﷺ climb up a rock on the mountain where he ﷺ prayed Zuhr sitting
- Anas ibn an-Nadr (the uncle of Anas ibn Malik) fought deep into enemy ranks, stating to Sa’d ibn Muadh, “Sa'd, I smell the fragrance of paradise beyond the hill of Uhud”; died with 70 wounds, only his sister could recognize him with a special mark on the tip of a finger
- Ziyad ibn as-Sakan died defending the Prophet ﷺ with his cheeks on the Prophet’s ﷺ foot
- Amr ibn al-Jamuh had a lame leg, was told by his 4 sons (who fought in Uhud) to not join; he asked the Prophet ﷺ and joined, then killed in battle
- Sad ibn ar-Rabi had 70 wounds, told Zayd ibn Thabit to convey greetings to the Prophet ﷺ and that he is inhaling the fragrance of the Garden; said, “tell my people you would have no excuse with God if the enemy lays its hand on the Apostle of God while you still live and breathe.”

#### Muslims Regain Confidence
- The Muslims realized the Prophet ﷺ was still alive and became re-energized
- The Prophet ﷺ struck and killed Ubayy ibn Khalaf
- Ali brought water in his shield, Fatima washed the blood from the Prophet’s face ﷺ but the wounds kept bleeding so she burnt a piece of mat and dressed the wound with ash and the bleeding stopped
- Aishah and Umm Sulaym carried drinking water on their backs in leather bags
- Umm Salit drew water to put in these bags
- Hind ibn Utbah and her women mutilated the dead bodies of Muslims, cut out Hamza’s liver, chewed it and threw it away
- Abu Sufyan went to the top of a hill and spoke with the Prophet ﷺ through Umar (ra)
- “God is our guardian but you have none”
- An appointment was made to meet again in Badr next year
- The dead were given a burial and the death of Hamza affected the Prophet ﷺ

#### The Exemplary Endurance
- Safiyyah bint Abd al-Muttalib was the full sister of Hamza
- She came to see Hamza, but the Prophet ﷺ asked her son Zubayr ibn al-Awwan to send her back because of how his body was mutilated
- She said, “Why? I know that my brother has been mutilated but it was for the sake of God.”
- She saw him, prayed for him, and the Prophet ﷺ had him buried at Uhud

#### Burial of Mus’ab Ibn Umayr
- Standard bearer of the Prophet ﷺ
- Before Islam was best dressed, lap of luxury
- In Uhud only had a small piece of coarse shroud only feet OR head covered
- Prophet ﷺ said cover his head and put some rushes over his feet
- Martyrs buried in pairs, the one who learned more Quran go first
- Buried without washing them

#### The Prophet’s ﷺ Influence on Womenfolk
- A woman’s husband, brother, and father had been killed at Uhud
- She first wanted to know the condition of the Prophet ﷺ
- She saw him ﷺ and said, “Now that you are safe, every adversity is gone”

#### Devotion and Faith
- Makkan army were complaining while returning home that they didn’t press
- The next day the Prophet ﷺ set out in pursuit of the enemy
- Despite their weary and wounded bodies they all obeyed
- Camped at Hamra al-Asad, 13 km from Medina, Mon-Wed
- Allah revealed 3:172-75 to acknowledge their devotion and love
- 70 were martyred, and 12 Makkans

#### A Lesson for the Muslims
- No one is safe from trials and loss
- Pre-warning and preparation for the death of the Prophet ﷺ
- Caution against turning their backs on Islam after his ﷺ demise
- “If he dies or is killed, will you then turn back on your heels?”
