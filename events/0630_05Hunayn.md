### Battle of Hunayn
#### 630

Placeholder: [Doctorsab's khulasa](../khulasa/doctorsab-chapter-19)

#### Assemblage of Hawazin
- Hawazin were old enemies of the Quraysh
- now that the Quraysh were Muslim, the Hawazin were the pagan leaders and wanted to defeat the Muslims
- Malik ibn Awf an-Nasri (chieftain) declared war against the Muslims
- Several other surrounding tribes joined except Ka’b and Kilab
- they brought everything with them: cattle, women, children; so that no one would retreat
- Durayd ibn as-Simmah instructed them to remain in the camp but be ready to fight as a single man
- the Muslims were 10k from Medina and 2k new Muslim and non-Muslim
- Safwan ibn Umayyad provided armor on credit to the Muslims, although he was not yet a Muslim

#### Not a sign of idolatry
- the new Muslims wanted a tree to offer sacrifices like they used to when they were non Muslim
- “Verily you will follow every custom of the people before you”

#### In the wadi of hunayn
- 10th or Shawwal, 8 AH
- the Muslims entered the valley but the Hawazin were already in the nooks and crannies and began to volley arrows then began a full force attack
- the Muslims began to retreat in confusion

#### Rift within the lute
- the new Muslims began to mock the fighters
- “Their flight will not stop before they get to the sea”
- “The spell of their sorcery has ended today”

#### Victory and peace of god
- this was a lesson that numbers didn’t matter and Muslims must depend on Allah for victory
- the Prophet ﷺ remained calm and when the enemy attack he threw a handful of dust into their eyes
- Abbas (ra) was ordered to call out to the Ansar who came running
- Allah sent down angels to help and the Hawazin were defeated
- many POWs were brought back

#### The last encounter
- the last stronghold of paganism was now gone

#### In Atwas
- a group of the Hawazin escaped to Taif
- Abu Amir al-Ashari led a group and stopped them
- the spoils of Hunayn were the largest ever
- 24,000 camels, 40,000 goats, 4000 uqiyyah of silver
- captives were 6000
- women, children, elderly, and non combatants were ordered not to be hurt
- a woman was killed in battle though
