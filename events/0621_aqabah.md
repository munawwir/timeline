### The First Pledge of 'Aqabah
#### 621

See Chapter 7 khulasat for more detail.

Around 620, Rasulullah ﷺ was inviting tribes that visited the Ka'bah for pilgrimage towards Islam. He would say:

> “O ye people, I have been sent to you as the messenger of God to call you to worship Him, to call on you to associate nothing with Him and to renounce everything you have elevated as His equal. Believe in God and His Apostle and protect me until I have made clear that which God has sent to me.”

[Abu Lahab](../bio/abu_lahab) often followed behind, saying "O ye people, the fellow wants you to cast off your obedience to al-Lat and al-Uzza and your allies, the jinn, and to exchange your gods for the wickedness and innovation he has brought. Don’t take orders from him nor pay him any heed."

It was around this time that Rasulullah ﷺ met with the people of Khazraj from Yathrib at 'Aqabah. When he shared some ayaat of the Quran with them, they exclaimed that this was the messenger prophesized to them by the Jews of Yathrib. They accepted Islam and returned to their homes to spread the message.

In 621, 12 men from the Ansar returned to meet Rasulullah ﷺ at 'Aqabah again. They took a pledge:

- not to steal
- not to fornicate
- not to kill their children
- to obey Rasulullah ﷺ in Haqq
- to associate nothing with Allah ﷻ

[Mus'ab ibn Umayrؓ](../bio/0594_Musab) was sent back with them to teach the Qur'an and spread Islam.
