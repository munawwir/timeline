### Permission to migrate to Madinah

Rasulullah ﷺ tells the people of Makkah to migrate to Madinah, but he himself remains in Makkah as he was not yet given permission to migrate. The Quraysh, of course, were not happy with this. They tried to stop the Muslims from leaving, since not only did these kuffar reject Islam they were so blinded by their ignorance they wished to stop others from hearing it lest they accept it. Perhaps it was out of arrogance, since they knew it was the Truth yet they refused to accept it.

Of the Muslims that migrated, many had to leave behind family, such as Abu Salamah, and wealth, such as Suhayb. Those who left were:

- [Umar](../bio/0583_Umar)
- [Talhah](../bio/0594_Talhah)
- [Hamzah](../bio/0568_Hamzah)
- [Zayd ibn Harithah](../bio/0581_Zayd)
- [Abd ar-Rahman ibn Awf](../bio/0581_Abdurrahman)
- [az-Zubayr ibn Awwam](../bio/0594_Zubayr)
- [Abu Hudhayfah](../bio/Abu_hudhayfah)
- [Uthman ibn Affan](../bio/0573_Uthman)
- several other

Those who remained included Rasulullah ﷺ and [Abu Bakr](../bio/0573_Abu_bakr) and [Alī](../bio/0600_Ali), and those who were restrained or held by the Makkan Kuffar.
