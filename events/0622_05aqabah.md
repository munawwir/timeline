#### 622

See Chapter 7 khulasat for more detail.

The year after the [first pledge of 'Aqabah](0621_aqabah) at the time of pilgrimage, 73 Ansar (including 2 women) came to visit Rasulullah ﷺ again at 'Aqabah. Rasulullah ﷺ was accompanied by his uncle, ['Abbas](../bio/0565_Abbas). Again, the people of Madinah took allegiance with Rasulullah ﷺ, but they requested that he leaves Makkah and comes to them.
