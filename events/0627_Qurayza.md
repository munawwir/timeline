### Invasion of Banū Qurayzah
#### 627 January

Placeholder: [Doctorsab's khulasa](../khulasa/doctorsab-chapter-13)

#### Banu Qurayzah’s Breach of Faith
- contract between Ansar, Muhajiroon, and Jews giving rights and responsibilities
- freedom of religion along with joint liability to protect one another
- mutual cooperation, goodwill, cordial relations
- Huyayy ibn Akhtab an- Nadri convinced Banu Qurayza to help the Quraysh
- Banu Qurayza prepared for war

#### Banu Qurayza Assailed
- Muslims put down their weapons after Khandaq
- Jibraeel came and said the angels have not put away their arms and relayed commandment from Allah to march on Banu Qurayza
- sieged x 25 days and then surrendered

#### Repentance of Abu Lubabah
- Banu Qurayza consulted with Abu Lubabah and many wailed and cried
- when they asked if they should surrender he pointed his hand to his throat
- realizing his mistake he tied himself to one of the mosque’s pillars until Allah revealed his forgiveness
- he was tied for 25 days until the Prophet ﷺ set him free

#### Truth in Action
- Aws asked to be lenient with Banu Qurayza
- Sad ibn Muadh was chosen as arbitrator
- Sad: men killed, property divided, women and children taken as captives

#### Decision consistent with the law of Moses
- Deuteronomy stated this exact punishment
- Book of Numbers: same but with the examples of the Midianites
- decision carried out
- Sallam ibn Abu’l Huqayq main aggressor was assassinated
- punishment was a deterrent and a firm statement to prevent future treachery
- also frightened and discourage the hypocrites

#### Benevolence and Largesse
- Muslims went to Najd and captured Thumamah ibn Athal (chief of Banu Hanifah)
- He was tied to a stump in the Prophet's ﷺ mosque
- Prophet ﷺ asked him, “What do you imagine will happen to you, Thumamah?”
- After 3 days was released, left the city and came back after taking a bath to accept Islam
- Went to Makkah for Umrah and blocked all grain from al-Yamamah
- Makkah wrote to the Prophet ﷺ and asked to lift the ban which he ﷺ did
