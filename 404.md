# اربع صفر اربع

من كسر الأصنام؟

This page is broken or the link that sent you here might have been mistyped. Some things you can try:

- Do a handstand.
- If the page was linking to a person or event, go to the index of [people](/timeline/bio) or [events](/timeline/events) and `ctrl + F` what you're looking for.
- Check if there are mistakes in the link you're on right now. For example, 'Abd al-Muttalib is a person, not an event, so "https://munawwir.github.io/timeline/events/0497_Abd_al_Muttalib" should be "https://munawwir.github.io/timeline/bio/0497_Abd_al_Muttalib".
- You can stop doing a handstand now.

Meanwhile, enjoy this calligraphy ~~I found online~~ I made painstakingly by hand and reflect on the reality that sometimes, things break.
